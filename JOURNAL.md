Starting with the journaling of this project!

found an amazing guide for the IC(IWRL6432), here it us https://www.ti.com/tool/TIDEP-01033#design-products

It is amazing and i started with the schematic too, i have plans that i will order BGA from LCSC and assemble myself home, but let's see what happens.
