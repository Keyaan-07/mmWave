# mmWave Radar
This project includes building a complete mmWave radar that could operate at 60GHz. It uses the Texas Instruments IWRL6432 as the radar IC. This radar IC is operable between 57GHz-64GHz. The main goal of this project is to make a small module to use this IC as a radar. 
The board is a 6 layer board(4 layer was possible but 6 layers was cheaper). The 6 layer board costs only $2.
